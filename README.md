# Animation-Showcase
A demo project where I put together stuff I learn about animation in Unity.

### I - The Basics - Finished on 2024-11-11
This part was all about deep diving into concepts I already knew the basics of, but have never bothered to take a closer, more detailed look.<br>
I have created a basic scene with one character and downloaded some animations from Mixamo. I learned and/or re-learned about:
* humanoid rigs
* troubleshooting humanoid rigs
* importing animations, adjusting the properties and customizing them
* moving the character via root motion
* setting up blend trees and blending animations via code

#### Cinemachine
It's not the main focus, but I also explore this package in more detail whenever opportunity presents itself.<br>
For now, the camera's pitch and yaw are controlled by a pointer (mouse/gamepad). The camera follows the player and it's values are taken into account when calculating the player's rotation.

TO-DO: Smoother/faster camera rotation.<br>
NEXT UP: Layers showcase. Set up a simple scene with objects the character can interact with.
